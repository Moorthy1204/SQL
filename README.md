# SQL Challenge Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL challenges completed over the course of multiple weeks. These challenges helped me master key SQL concepts, including database design, data aggregation, optimization, and complex queries. Below are the case studies I have worked on, along with the approach and techniques used for each challenge.

## 📋 Challenge Overview – 🏥 Hospital Management

This set of SQL challenges focuses on analyzing hospital data to extract meaningful insights about patients, doctors, and visits. The problems are designed to simulate real-world healthcare scenarios and require the use of **SQL JOINs**, aggregations, and filtering techniques.

### Key Objectives:

* Identify the **most frequent patients** and their visit patterns.
* Determine the **top doctors** based on the number of consultations.
* Analyze **daily or monthly hospital traffic** to uncover peak hours or days.
* Use **JOINs** to combine multiple tables such as:

  * `Patients`, `Doctors`, and `Visits`
  * `Departments` and `Staff`
* Track **doctor-patient relationships**, visit history, and department-level performance.
* Handle edge cases like **missing data**, **duplicate visits**, or **inactive doctors**.

These challenges test your ability to combine data from multiple related tables and generate reports commonly used in healthcare analytics and hospital dashboards.
