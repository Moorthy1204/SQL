# SQL Challenge Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL challenges completed over the course of multiple weeks. These challenges helped me master key SQL concepts, including database design, data aggregation, optimization, and complex queries. Below are the case studies I have worked on, along with the approach and techniques used for each challenge.

# Challenges Overview
Here’s an updated **Challenge Overview** section specifically for the **Hospital domain**, mentioning the use of **JOIN operations** as requested:

1. Hospital Management

This set of SQL challenges focuses on analyzing hospital data to extract meaningful insights about patients, doctors, and visits. The problems are designed to simulate real-world healthcare scenarios and require the use of **SQL JOINs**, aggregations, and filtering techniques.

### Key Objectives:

* Identify the **most frequent patients** and their visit patterns.
* Determine the **top doctors** based on the number of consultations.
* Analyze **daily or monthly hospital traffic** to uncover peak hours or days.
* Use **JOINs** to combine multiple tables such as:

  * `Patients`, `Doctors`, and `Visits`
  * `Departments` and `Staff`
* Track **doctor-patient relationships**, visit history, and department-level performance.
* Handle edge cases like **missing data**, **duplicate visits**, or **inactive doctors**.

Here’s the **Challenge Overview** section for the **Netflix domain**, as requested — with a clear note that **JOINs are not used** in this set of challenges:

## 📋 Challenge Overview – 🎬 Netflix Streaming Analytics

This set of SQL challenges focuses on analyzing **viewer behavior and content performance** on a streaming platform similar to Netflix. The dataset is structured to allow deep insights using a single table or minimal table relationships, without requiring JOIN operations.

### Key Objectives:

* Identify the **top 5 most-watched movies or shows** based on user views.
* Analyze **daily, weekly, or monthly streaming trends**.
* Calculate the **average watch time per user** or per content title.
* Determine **active users** and **engagement rates**.
* Explore **genre popularity** and content preferences.
* Uncover **binge-watching patterns** or peak streaming hours.

These challenges are ideal for practicing **aggregation**, **GROUP BY**, **ORDER BY**, **HAVING**, and **filtering operations** in SQL — all done without using JOINs. The dataset assumes a simplified streaming log format that represents typical user interaction data.

Here’s the **Challenge Overview** section for the **Supermarket domain**, with a note that **JOINs are not used**:

## 📋 Challenge Overview – 🛒 Supermarket Sales Analysis

This set of SQL challenges revolves around analyzing sales data from a supermarket. The focus is on extracting actionable insights directly from a single sales table or a flat dataset structure, without the need for JOIN operations.

### Key Objectives:

* Identify the **top-performing product categories** based on total sales.
* Track **daily, weekly, or monthly revenue trends**.
* Determine **best-selling products** and their sales volume.
* Calculate **total revenue per customer** or **per region**.
* Analyze **customer purchase frequency** and spending patterns.
* Monitor **sales performance over time** to spot growth or decline.

These challenges are structured to strengthen your skills in **data aggregation**, **sorting**, **grouping**, and **filtering**, using only one table. Ideal for scenarios where data comes from POS (point of sale) systems or export reports without relational dependencies.
